__Crowd Analysis in Banking environments__ ( as a part of the SBI Stockroom Problem Set ): The SBI Stockroom project is mainly aimed at developing an automatic customer identification system for banks,using facial recognition and handwriting matching. 

As a part of the facial recognition module ,we aim to develop an algorithm to recognise faces in a crowded banking environment. This should help make the entire process more smooth and consumer friendly.
