title: "Forest Surveillance"
description: "Use deep learning techniques to effectively monitor forests"
---
India has a major part of its land area as forests. A lot of resources and effort goes into monitoring these forests and the wildlife in them and preventing forest fires, poaching etc.

This project essentially aims to invoke the principles of Deep learning in forest surveillance and animal migration analysis and intelligently monitor forests. We envision to build an integrated module which can detect forest fires, animals etc so as to make this entire process of monitoring forests more efficient and reduce the burden on the people involved in it.
