description: "Using covnets for Audio-Visual Recognition and Lip Reading"

This project aims to use dual channel convnets to perform Audio-Video recognition as well as synchronisation. Synchronisation is done to ensure that there is no lag between the audio and video parts.

Also, in a particular application of this project, we are also handling Lip-reading.
