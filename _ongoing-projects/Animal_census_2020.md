title: "Image Based Census for Animals"
description: "Detection of animals in pictures and then identifying separate individuals of the same species"
---

**Goals:**

- Create a software to detect animals in pictures and then identify separate individuals of the same species.
- Focusing mainly on Chital (Spotted Deer), create a dataset for the animals and then run software over it.

**Objective:**

The aim is to help forest officials to take a census using images from motion trap cameras.

**Method:**

- Break up task into four steps:
  - Creating a dataset
  - Detection of animals in image
  - Identification of individual
  - Logging entry into database
- Study relevant courses and topics like CS231n, PyTorch, etc.
- Explore all previous work done in this field, look for resources that might aid the process.
- Compare current detection algorithms and modify them to adapt to Chital.
- Create an identification software that uses the individuals&#39; spot patterns to distinguish them using neural networks.
- Finally, package the software into a presentable media/format.
