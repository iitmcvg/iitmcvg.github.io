**Goal:**

The project Smartcopter aims to achieve completely autonomous navigation in a GPS denied environment, by using completely vision-based systems such as normal cameras, depth cameras, tracking cameras, etc. and analyzing the depth information and other relevant data thus obtained.

**Objective:**

We intend to work on obstacle avoidance, experiment on path planning algorithms to achieve completely autonomous navigation in a GPS denied environment.

**Method:**

- Firstly, we shall try implementing basic obstacle avoidance to make sure that the drone is capable of safe flight.
- We shall then try implementing traditional global path planning using Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL), Moveit and PX4 avoidance.
- We then go a step ahead, for this is a &quot;smart&quot; copter, we plan on using Deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms to implement path planning, which would have happened previously, the traditional way.
- There are various applications to this project some of which are avoidance, surveying and swarm missions, delivery applications, etc.
