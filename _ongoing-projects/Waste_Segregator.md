title: "Automatic Waste Segregator"
description: "For dynamic and effective solid waste management"
---
India generates 62 million tonnes of solid waste per annum and has a rather rooted waste management problem which is spiralling out of control. At the heart of this lies the fact that we donâ€™t segregate our waste - with barely 15% of municipal solid waste (MSW) that reaches our landfills being segregated .The key to efficient waste management is to ensure proper segregation of waste at the source.

Even the marginal segregation that happens at the household level gets undone at the municipal or district level of collection. Recognising this need for dynamic and effective sorting at the grassroot level, we are working on building a small scale and municipal level segregator. The initial prototype has already been completed for the small scale segregator, and presently we are aiming to scale to the municipal level.
